# GAN-model-extraction-attack
This repository contains the source code for the paper “Towards Model Extraction Attacks in GAN-Based Image Translation via Domain Shift Mitigation” accepted by AAAI 2024 conference.

We are currently in the process of organizing the codebase, and we aim to complete this task by April 2024. Once the code is organized, we will update this README with more detailed information on how to use the code.
